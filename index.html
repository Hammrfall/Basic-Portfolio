            <p>
                I was born in Wisconsin, raised in Alabama, and live in Florida.
                I enjoy writing, coding, and playing board games. I have a great family
                that is super supportive, and lots of fun to be with.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that communication of any kind should be clear, interesting, and compelling.
                Anything less is laziness on the part of the communicator.  There is too much
                that is interesting in this world to ever be boring.
